I built a basic calculator project during my internship at CodSoft!  Building the UI with a display and 
buttons was a great way learn HTML and CSS.
Implement logic and functionality using event listeners and JavaScript functions that handled user input,
performed calculations based on selected operators,and displayed the results.
This project allowed me to solidify my understanding of these core technologies and their practical applications.
