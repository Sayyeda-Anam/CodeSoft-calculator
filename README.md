 I built a basic calculator project during my internship at CodSoft!  Building the UI with a display and buttons was a great way to learn HTML and CSS.
 Implement logic and functionality using event listeners and JavaScript functions that handled user input, performed calculations based on selected operators,
 and displayed the results.
 This project allowed me to solidify my understanding of these core technologies and their practical applications.
